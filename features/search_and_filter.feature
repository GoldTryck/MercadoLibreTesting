Feature: Search and filter products on Mercado Libre
  As a Mercado Libre user
  I want to search and filter products
  So I can find the best deals matching my criteria

  Background:
    Given I am on the Mercado Libre landing page
    And I select as country "Mexico"

  Scenario Outline: Search for <product> with filters
    When I search for "<product>"
    And I filter by condition "<condition>"
    And I filter by location "<location>"
    And I sort by price "<sort_order>"
    Then I should see the name and price of the first 5 products

    Examples:
      | product        | condition | location         | sort_order   |
      | Play Station 5 | Nuevo     | Distrito Federal | Mayor precio |
